# Logo Files

## Current Status:

**Temporary Placeholder:** `logo-placeholder.svg` (gradient "C" logo)
**Your Real Logo:** `logo.png` (uploaded to HostGator, not in git repo yet)

---

## How to Add Your Real Logo to Git:

### Option 1: Download from HostGator
1. Login to HostGator cPanel
2. Go to File Manager → public_html/images/logos/
3. Select `logo.png`
4. Click **Download**
5. Upload it here: `/images/logos/logo.png`

### Option 2: Provide to Claude
- If you have the logo file on your computer
- Tell me and I'll guide you through adding it

---

## When Deployed to HostGator:

Your real `logo.png` will automatically show because:
- The HTML points to `images/logos/logo.png`
- HostGator already has your logo at that path
- It will override the placeholder when deployed

---

## Files in this folder:

- `logo-placeholder.svg` - Temporary gradient logo (for git preview)
- `logo.png` - **YOUR REAL LOGO** (upload here or already on HostGator)

---

**Note:** The placeholder is just for development. Your real logo will show when deployed to HostGator.
