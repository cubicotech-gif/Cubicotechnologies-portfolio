# ⚡ HOSTGATOR - QUICK START GUIDE

## 🎯 **YOU HAVE 3 CHOICES**

### **Current Situation:**
- ✅ HostGator hosting with WordPress (4 pages)
- 🆕 Want to add new portfolio website

### **Choose Your Deployment Strategy:**

---

## **OPTION 1: Replace WordPress** ⚠️

```
BEFORE:
https://yourdomain.com → WordPress site

AFTER:
https://yourdomain.com → New Portfolio (WordPress DELETED)
```

**Choose if:** You don't need WordPress anymore

**Risk:** ❌ WordPress site will be DELETED

---

## **OPTION 2: Subdomain** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

```
BEFORE:
https://yourdomain.com → WordPress site

AFTER:
https://yourdomain.com → WordPress site (SAFE)
https://portfolio.yourdomain.com → New Portfolio
```

**Choose if:** You want both sites, professional separation

**Risk:** ✅ No risk, both sites work

---

## **OPTION 3: Subfolder**

```
BEFORE:
https://yourdomain.com → WordPress site

AFTER:
https://yourdomain.com → WordPress site (SAFE)
https://yourdomain.com/portfolio → New Portfolio
```

**Choose if:** You want both sites, simpler setup

**Risk:** ✅ No risk, both sites work

---

## 🚀 **AFTER YOU CHOOSE:**

**I will:**
1. ✅ Update GitHub Actions workflow for HostGator
2. ✅ Set correct deployment folder
3. ✅ Help you get FTP credentials
4. ✅ Add credentials to GitHub Secrets
5. ✅ Test deployment
6. ✅ Make your site LIVE!

**You will:**
1. Just tell me which option (1, 2, or 3)
2. Give me your domain name
3. Get FTP credentials from HostGator cPanel
4. Add them to GitHub (I'll show you how)

**Then:** Push code → Website updates automatically! ✨

## 💡 **MY RECOMMENDATION:**

**Choose OPTION 2 (Subdomain)** because:

✅ Keeps WordPress safe (no risk)
✅ Professional URL (portfolio.yourdomain.com)
✅ Clean separation of sites
✅ Easy to manage both
✅ Can delete WordPress later if needed

1. Which option do you want? **(1, 2, or 3)**
2. What's your domain name?
